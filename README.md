AGPushNote
==========

Custom view for easily displaying in-app push notification that feels like default iOS banners.

![Demo](https://github.com/relaxone22/AGPushNote/blob/master/Resources/push_ex.gif)

* Will look like iOS7 on iOS7 and will (try to) look like iOS6 on iOS6.
* Both block and protocol ways are available to control the action of tapping the message and showing/dismissing the view.
